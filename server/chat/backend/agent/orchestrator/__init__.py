"""Multi-agent RCA orchestrator.

A lead orchestrator triages each background RCA. For trivial incidents it
falls through to the existing single-agent ReAct loop. For complex
incidents it fans out N parallel read-only sub-agents via LangGraph's
``Send`` API, each with an isolated context window and a curated tool
subset. Each sub-agent writes a schema-validated ``findings.md`` artifact
to object storage; the lead reads only those artifacts (never their
transcripts) and synthesizes.

Gated by the ``ORCHESTRATOR_ENABLED`` env var (default: false). When set
to false, ``is_orchestrator_enabled()`` returns False and
``workflow._create_workflow`` returns the existing single-node graph
unchanged.
